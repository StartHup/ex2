In this milestone we will cover some of the tasks.
I hope that if we can get this done - the next part, which I believe is wider in code, should be more straightforward and easier to plan.

We will achieve:
-Adjustments from first assignment (no double contacts, sort with built in function)
-Main menu (we must get rid of first assignments test code). This includes printing the menu UI and having built in test runs.
  (Note - at this point the options in menu won't be complete as not all apps are ready. That's okay, at least we'll have the menu set up)
Creating the Media app, including:
-Plannig the Framework (I planned over all four classes - abstract class Media, Song and Video that inherit from Media, and MediaPlayer that implements App)
-Creating the classes and implementing them
